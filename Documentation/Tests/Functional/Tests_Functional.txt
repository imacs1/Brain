## Fields:
- **testCase**:  
  Identifier for the functional test case being executed.

- **description**:  
  Detailed explanation of the test case and its expected outcomes.

- **inputs**:  
  Input data or parameters required to execute the test.

- **expectedResults**:  
  The expected results or behaviors for the test case.

- **actualResults**:  
  The observed results after test execution.

- **status**:  
  Indicates whether the test passed, failed, or is pending.

---

## Scope
Functional tests validate the system's end-to-end behavior by ensuring workflows, services, and integrations function as expected in real-world scenarios.

---

## Example Use Cases
1. **Workflow Execution**:  
   Test whether `WF_BUSINESS_PLAN` generates a complete business plan with valid user inputs.

2. **Service Integration**:  
   Validate that the MessageService correctly routes messages to their intended destinations.

3. **User Interaction**:  
   Ensure the UI handles user inputs gracefully, invoking the correct backend actions.

---

## Execution Process
1. **Setup**:  
   Configure the testing environment, ensuring all dependencies are available.

2. **Run Tests**:  
   Execute functional test cases using predefined inputs and scenarios.

3. **Validate Outputs**:  
   Compare actual results with expected outcomes to determine the test status.

4. **Log Results**:  
   Record detailed logs for passed and failed tests, including observed discrepancies.

---

## Best Practices
1. **Comprehensive Scenarios**:  
   Cover all critical workflows and edge cases in functional test plans.

2. **Reproducibility**:  
   Ensure tests are repeatable by using consistent input data and configurations.

3. **Automation**:  
   Use testing frameworks to automate execution and validation processes.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Integration with CI/CD**:  
   Automatically execute functional tests during deployment pipelines.

2. **Dynamic Test Cases**:  
   Generate test cases dynamically based on real-time system usage patterns.

3. **Enhanced Reporting**:  
   Provide detailed analytics and visualizations of functional test outcomes.
