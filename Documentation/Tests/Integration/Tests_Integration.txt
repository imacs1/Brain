## Fields:
- **testCase**:  
  Identifier for the integration test case being executed.

- **description**:  
  Explanation of the integration scenario and expected outcomes.

- **servicesInvolved**:  
  List of services or components interacting during the test.

- **inputs**:  
  Input data or configurations provided for the test.

- **expectedResults**:  
  The anticipated results or system behaviors during the test.

- **actualResults**:  
  The observed outcomes after executing the test.

- **status**:  
  Indicates whether the test passed, failed, or is pending.

---

## Scope
Integration tests validate interactions between multiple services, components, or modules to ensure seamless communication and functionality across the system.

---

## Example Use Cases
1. **Workflow and Service Coordination**:  
   Test whether the WorkflowService correctly calls the MessageService during the execution of `WF_BUSINESS_PLAN`.

2. **Database Integration**:  
   Validate that services correctly read from and write to the database during task execution.

3. **API Communication**:  
   Ensure external API integrations (e.g., third-party AI services) work as expected when invoked.

---

## Execution Process
1. **Setup**:  
   Configure the environment, including mock services or databases as needed.

2. **Run Tests**:  
   Execute integration tests using predefined scenarios and configurations.

3. **Validate Outputs**:  
   Compare the system's behavior against expected results to determine test outcomes.

4. **Log Results**:  
   Record detailed logs for passed and failed test cases, highlighting observed discrepancies.

---

## Best Practices
1. **Mocking External Dependencies**:  
   Use mocks or stubs for external services to ensure reliable and isolated testing.

2. **Layered Testing**:  
   Validate interactions at different layers (e.g., API, database, service-to-service).

3. **Automated Execution**:  
   Automate integration tests for consistent and efficient execution.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Dynamic Test Scenarios**:  
   Generate integration test cases based on real-time system interactions.

2. **Enhanced Logging**:  
   Provide detailed logging with visual flowcharts of service interactions.

3. **Performance Testing**:  
   Extend integration tests to include performance metrics under load.
