## Fields:
- **testCase**:  
  Identifier for the unit test case being executed.

- **description**:  
  Detailed explanation of the test and its purpose.

- **componentUnderTest**:  
  The specific function, method, or class being tested.

- **inputs**:  
  Input data or parameters required for the test.

- **expectedResults**:  
  The anticipated outcomes for the test.

- **actualResults**:  
  The observed outcomes after executing the test.

- **status**:  
  Indicates whether the test passed, failed, or is pending.

---

## Scope
Unit tests validate the functionality of individual components or methods in isolation, ensuring they behave as expected under various conditions.

---

## Example Use Cases
1. **Action Handlers**:  
   Test whether individual action handlers process inputs and return expected results.

2. **Data Validation**:  
   Validate that data processing methods correctly filter, transform, and output results.

3. **Utility Functions**:  
   Test reusable utility methods (e.g., encryption, logging) for accuracy and reliability.

---

## Execution Process
1. **Setup**:  
   Prepare the test environment, including any necessary mock objects or test data.

2. **Run Tests**:  
   Execute individual unit tests using predefined inputs and scenarios.

3. **Validate Outputs**:  
   Compare actual results to expected outcomes to determine test success.

4. **Log Results**:  
   Record detailed logs of test execution, highlighting any discrepancies or errors.

---

## Best Practices
1. **Isolate Components**:  
   Ensure each test only validates the behavior of the component under test.

2. **Automate Tests**:  
   Use testing frameworks to automate execution and validation of unit tests.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**:  
   Create test cases for all edge cases, error conditions, and typical scenarios.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Mocking Libraries**:  
   Integrate advanced mocking tools to simulate dependencies more effectively.

2. **Code Coverage Metrics**:  
   Track and improve code coverage for comprehensive testing.

3. **Continuous Integration**:  
   Automatically run unit tests as part of CI pipelines for immediate feedback.
