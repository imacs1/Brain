### **Overview**
The LoadBalancer module in Project Brain manages dynamic routing and prioritization of queued messages across services. It ensures that critical messages (override) are processed immediately, while other messages are processed proportionally based on predefined priority weights.

### **Core Features**
1. **Priority Queues:**
   - Messages are organized into separate priority-based queues:
     - **Override Priority:** Exclusive queue for critical messages.
     - **High Priority:** General processing queue for high-importance messages.
     - **Medium Priority:** Queue for standard operations.
     - **Low Priority:** Queue for low-impact or non-urgent tasks.

2. **Weighted Processing Logic:**
   - **Override Messages:**
     - Processed first and exclusively until the override queue is empty.
   - **High, Medium, and Low Priority Messages:**
     - Processed using a **6:3:1 ratio**.
     - Example:
       - For every 10 non-override messages processed:
         - 6 are high-priority.
         - 3 are medium-priority.
         - 1 is low-priority.

3. **Dynamic Routing:**
   - Routes messages to available service instances, balancing speed and capacity.

4. **Priority Enforcement:**
   - Guarantees that override and high-priority messages are handled promptly.

5. **Real-Time Monitoring and Adjustment:**
   - Tracks queue lengths and service health to optimize routing dynamically.

### **Priority Queue Implementation**
1. **Queue Structure:**
   - Separate queues are maintained for each priority level:
     - **Override Queue:** Processes all override messages first.
     - **High Priority Queue:** Holds 60% of non-override workload.
     - **Medium Priority Queue:** Holds 30% of non-override workload.
     - **Low Priority Queue:** Holds 10% of non-override workload.

2. **Processing Order:**
   - Override messages are always processed before other priorities.
   - When override is empty, the system alternates between high, medium, and low-priority messages using the defined **6:3:1 ratio**.

3. **Example Scenario:**
   - Assume 10,000 messages:
     - 500 are override (processed first).
     - 9,500 are divided into high, medium, and low queues:
       - **High Priority:** 5,700 messages (60% of 9,500).
       - **Medium Priority:** 2,850 messages (30% of 9,500).
       - **Low Priority:** 950 messages (10% of 9,500).
   - Processing Order:
     - Process all 500 override messages first.
     - Alternate processing of remaining 9,500 messages in the ratio of 6 high, 3 medium, 1 low.

### **Routing Algorithm**
1. **Priority Selection:**
   - Checks priority queues in order: override, high, medium, low.
   - Selects the next message based on the weighted ratio if override is empty.

2. **Service Instance Selection:**
   - Evaluates the best service instance based on:
     - Speed.
     - Current workload.
     - Availability metrics.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - If a service becomes overloaded, the LoadBalancer reroutes messages to other instances.

### **Integration with Other Modules**
1. **Message Module:**
   - Supplies metadata (priority, size, etc.) for messages to be queued appropriately.
2. **Monitoring Module:**
   - Provides real-time metrics on queue lengths and service health.
3. **RBAC and Cost Tracking:**
   - Ensures priority processing adheres to user entitlements and tracks associated costs.

### **Key Design Principles**
1. **Efficiency:**
   - Guarantees prompt handling of critical messages.
2. **Fairness:**
   - Enforces proportional processing of non-override messages across high, medium, and low priorities.
3. **Scalability:**
   - Adapts to increased workloads by dynamically adding service instances.
4. **Transparency:**
   - Logs routing and prioritization decisions for auditing and optimization.

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **Adaptive Ratios:**
   - Dynamically adjust ratios based on system load or message volume.
2. **Enhanced Visual Monitoring:**
   - Provide detailed dashboards for queue and priority insights.
3. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Predict optimal routing and prioritization based on historical trends.

### **Conclusion**
The LoadBalancer ensures robust, fair, and efficient processing of messages in Project Brain. With priority-based queues and weighted distribution, it balances responsiveness and workload management effectively.
