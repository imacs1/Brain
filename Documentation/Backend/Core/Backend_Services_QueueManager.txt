### **Overview**
The Queue Manager service orchestrates the queuing system in Project Brain. It manages priority-based message processing, dead-letter handling, and dynamic resource allocation to ensure seamless and efficient operations.

### **Core Responsibilities**
1. **Priority Management**:
   - Organizes messages into separate priority-based queues (Override, High, Medium, Low).
   - Implements 6:3:1 processing ratios for High, Medium, and Low priorities, ensuring fair allocation.

2. **Dead-Letter Handling**:
   - Captures unprocessable messages in a dedicated dead-letter queue.
   - Supports inspection and manual retry mechanisms.

3. **Dynamic Integration**:
   - Works with the Load Balancer to assign messages to the fastest service instances.
   - Monitors queue lengths and dynamically scales resources.

4. **RBAC and Quota Management**:
   - Enforces RBAC policies for queue access and message processing limits.
   - Integrates with the Quota Manager for throttling based on user entitlements.

5. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Tracks metrics such as queue lengths, processing times, and error rates.
   - Provides data for real-time dashboards and alerts.

### **Key Features**
1. **Real-Time Prioritization**:
   - Processes Override messages immediately, followed by High, Medium, and Low priorities.
   - Ensures critical tasks are addressed with minimal latency.

2. **Scalable Processing**:
   - Automatically adjusts processing capacity during high loads.
   - Supports both vertical and horizontal scaling.

3. **Integration with Workflow Engine**:
   - Receives and routes messages originating from workflows.
   - Updates message statuses and logs results for transparency.

4. **Error Recovery**:
   - Automatically retries failed messages based on predefined policies.
   - Logs errors and escalates unresolved issues to administrators.

### **Service Workflow**
1. **Message Ingestion**:
   - Accepts messages from various sources (e.g., workflows, APIs).
   - Assigns priorities and adds metadata such as GUIDs and timestamps.

2. **Queue Allocation**:
   - Places messages into appropriate priority-based queues.
   - Updates the Load Balancer with real-time queue information.

3. **Message Processing**:
   - Retrieves messages from queues based on priority ratios.
   - Assigns tasks to service instances via Load Balancer integration.

4. **Dead-Letter Handling**:
   - Moves unprocessable messages to the dead-letter queue.
   - Provides tools for inspection, retry, or deletion.

### **Design Principles**
1. **Modularity**:
   - Decouples queuing logic from processing services for scalability and maintainability.

2. **Resilience**:
   - Ensures continuous operation with fault-tolerant mechanisms.

3. **Transparency**:
   - Logs all queue operations for auditability and debugging.

### **Example JSON Configuration**
```json
{
    "queue_manager": {
        "priority_ratios": {
            "high": 6,
            "medium": 3,
            "low": 1
        },
        "retry_policy": {
            "max_retries": 5,
            "retry_interval_ms": 1000
        },
        "dead_letter_queue": {
            "enabled": true,
            "retention_period_days": 7
        }
    }
}
### **Future Enhancements**
  - Predictive analytics for queue load balancing.
  - Advanced error classification and automated resolution for dead-letter messages.
  - Integration with external queuing systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka.
