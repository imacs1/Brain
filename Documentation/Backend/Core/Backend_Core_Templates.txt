# Backend Core: Templates

## Overview
The Templates component in the backend core is designed to provide a reusable and configurable approach for common workflows and system tasks. Templates streamline processes by reducing redundancy and enhancing consistency across the system.

---

## Features
1. **Predefined Workflow Templates**:
   - Contains reusable workflow structures for common operations (e.g., data processing, message routing).
   - Supports parameterized inputs for customization.

2. **System Configuration Templates**:
   - Includes base configurations for system components (e.g., RBAC rules, quota policies).
   - Enables quick setup and modification for deployments.

3. **Template Versioning**:
   - Templates are version-controlled to ensure backward compatibility.
   - Older versions are archived but accessible for reference.

4. **Dynamic Loading**:
   - Templates are dynamically loaded at runtime based on system context.
   - Supports templated overrides for specific workflows or components.

---

## Structure
Templates are categorized as follows:
1. **Workflow Templates**:
   - Located in `Config/Workflows`.
   - Define standardized workflows with modular tasks.

2. **Configuration Templates**:
   - Stored in `Config/Templates`.
   - Include JSON/YAML files defining base configurations for various services.

---

## Example
**Sample Workflow Template** (JSON):
```json
{
    "workflowName": "DataProcessing",
    "tasks": [
        { "taskName": "LoadData", "parameters": { "source": "s3://bucket-name" } },
        { "taskName": "TransformData", "parameters": { "script": "transform.py" } },
        { "taskName": "SaveData", "parameters": { "destination": "db://database" } }
    ]
}
## Integration
1. Template Loader:

  - A built-in loader dynamically fetches and applies templates during execution.

2. Template API:

  - Exposes endpoints for managing, retrieving, and updating templates.

## Error Handling
1. Validation Errors:

  - Invalid templates are logged and rejected at runtime.

2. Fallback Mechanism:

  - If a template is unavailable, the system falls back to a default configuration.

## Testing
  - Unit tests validate template structures and loader behavior.
  - Integration tests ensure templates function correctly in workflows.
