### **Overview**
The error handling system in Project Brain ensures robust fault tolerance by identifying, logging, and mitigating errors efficiently. It is designed to integrate seamlessly with the logging system and other core components to provide a holistic approach to system resilience.

### **Core Features**
1. **Error Classification**:
   - Errors are categorized into `Critical`, `Major`, and `Minor`.
   - Critical errors trigger immediate alerts and possible system shutdown.
   - Major errors invoke recovery mechanisms, while minor errors are logged for review.

2. **Integration with Logging**:
   - All errors are logged with detailed metadata, including timestamps, GUIDs, and affected components.
   - Errors can trigger proactive monitoring alerts.

3. **Dead-Letter Queues**:
   - Unprocessable messages are moved to a dead-letter queue for later inspection.
   - Provides a fallback for persistent issues in workflows or actions.

4. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Automatic retries for transient errors.
   - Stateful recovery for critical processes to prevent data loss.

5. **Proactive Monitoring**:
   - Integrated with the monitoring system to detect and address potential issues before they escalate.
   - Real-time error metrics and dashboards.

### **Implementation Details**
1. **Error Metadata**:
   - Every error entry includes:
     - Error Type (Critical, Major, Minor)
     - Timestamp (UTC)
     - Service or Workflow
     - Correlation GUID for audit trail

2. **Retry Policies**:
   - Configurable retry limits and backoff strategies.
   - Retries can escalate error severity if limits are exceeded.

3. **Notification System**:
   - Real-time alerts for critical errors via email, SMS, or integrated tools.
   - Configurable notification preferences based on error types.

4. **Error Isolation**:
   - Isolates affected workflows or actions to prevent cascading failures.
   - Ensures system-wide stability during fault recovery.

5. **Error Logging Example**:
   ```json
   {
       "timestamp": "2024-12-30T20:30:00Z",
       "guid": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
       "error_type": "Critical",
       "service": "MessageService",
       "message": "Failed to process incoming message",
       "details": "Connection timeout with external API"
   }

### **Design Principles**
  1. Resilience:

    - Ensures system availability even during error conditions.
    - Mitigates impact through isolation and recovery.

  2. Transparency:
    - Detailed error logs provide insight into issues for developers and system administrators.
    - Error lifecycle tracking for post-mortem analysis.

  3. Scalability:
    - Designed to handle high error volumes without degrading system performance.
    - Supports distributed error handling in multi-instance setups.

### **Future Enhancements**
  - AI-driven root cause analysis for recurring errors.
  - Enhanced dead-letter queue management with automated classification.
  - Expanded integration with external monitoring tools.
