### Quota and Throttling Overview

Quota and throttling are integral to Project Brain for managing resource allocation, preventing system exploitation, and ensuring fair usage. These mechanisms regulate resource consumption, enforce user limits, and provide elasticity for high-demand scenarios.

---

### Key Features
1. **Quota Enforcement**:
   - Monitors resource usage for users and groups.
   - Enforces limits based on account types (Freemium, Premium, Enterprise).
   - Dynamically adjusts quotas for real-time demand balancing.

2. **RBAC Integration**:
   - Role-based control ensures specific actions are accessible only to authorized roles.
   - Custom RBAC policies enforce granular access restrictions.

3. **Throttling Mechanisms**:
   - Limits concurrent resource usage to prevent overloading.
   - Implements time-based throttling for high-traffic scenarios.

4. **Scalable Design**:
   - Supports distributed environments with quota-sharing across instances.
   - Handles cross-instance quota reconciliation.

### Quota Management

#### Fields
- **quota**: 
  Maximum allowable usage for a user, role, or service.
- **usage**: 
  Tracks current usage against defined quotas.
- **role**: 
  RBAC role defining user permissions and limits.
- **timeWindow**: 
  Specifies periods for applying quotas (e.g., hourly, daily).

#### Examples
- Freemium accounts: Limited to 100 actions/day.
- Premium accounts: 1000 actions/day with higher priority.
- Enterprise accounts: Customizable quotas based on contract terms.

---

### RBAC Throttling and Quota Integration

#### Fields
- **role**:
  Defines user roles such as Viewer, Editor, Administrator.
- **permissions**:
  Maps allowable actions for each role.
- **throttlingPolicy**:
  Configures limits for specific roles or services.
- **quotaLinkage**:
  Associates RBAC roles with quota allocations.

#### Workflow
1. **Request Validation**:
   - Validate user role and permissions against RBAC rules.
2. **Quota Check**:
   - Evaluate current usage against quota limits.
3. **Throttle Enforcement**:
   - Delay or block requests exceeding throttling thresholds.

#### Examples
- Editor Role: Can execute workflows but throttled to 100 concurrent executions.
- Viewer Role: Read-only access, unlimited API queries within a quota of 10,000/day.

---

### Error Handling

- **Quota Exceeded**:
  Logs and informs the user when exceeding limits.
- **Role Mismatch**:
  Denies access and logs unauthorized attempts.

---

### Security and Governance

1. **RBAC Enforcement**:
   - Validates every request against permissions and quotas.
2. **Audit Logs**:
   - Detailed logs capture quota breaches and throttling actions.
3. **Encryption**:
   - Secures quota configurations and usage data.

---

### Future Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Throttling**:
   - Real-time scaling based on system load and predictive analytics.
2. **Custom Quota Plans**:
   - User-configurable quota limits via the WebUI.
3. **Granular Throttling Policies**:
   - Advanced configurations for time-based and role-specific throttling.

---

### Conclusion
Quota management and RBAC throttling ensure Project Brain remains scalable, secure, and fair. These systems allow for efficient resource utilization, aligning with user needs and system stability.
