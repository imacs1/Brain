# Queuing Mechanism

## Overview
The queuing mechanism in Project Brain ensures efficient processing of messages based on priority and user entitlements. It supports dynamic message routing, real-time prioritization, and resource optimization.

## Core Features

1. **Priority-Based Queues**
   - Messages are categorized into priority levels:
     - **Override**: Highest priority, processed immediately (100% allocation).
     - **High**: Processed with a 60% allocation relative to other non-override messages.
     - **Medium**: Allocated 30% of processing resources.
     - **Low**: Allocated 10% of processing resources.
   - Example processing distribution: For every 100 messages, process 60 high, 30 medium, and 10 low-priority messages after override messages.

2. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
   - Override messages are prioritized until completion.
   - Remaining priorities are processed in the defined ratio using a fair distribution algorithm.
   - Resource throttling is applied using RBAC rules to ensure equitable access.

3. **Queue Isolation**
   - Each priority level is isolated in separate queues to ensure proportional handling.
   - Isolation ensures that lower-priority messages do not block higher-priority processing.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Queue metrics (e.g., length, throughput) are tracked and displayed in the monitoring dashboard.
   - Bottlenecks are identified, enabling proactive scaling.

5. **Integration with Load Balancer**
   - The queuing mechanism integrates seamlessly with the load balancer.
   - Messages are routed to the fastest available service instance based on priority.

## Workflow Example

1. Messages are received and categorized into priority queues.
2. The system processes override messages first.
3. After override messages are cleared, other priorities are processed in a 6:3:1 ratio (high:medium:low).
4. If the queue exceeds thresholds, dynamic scaling adds service instances.

## Implementation Notes

- **Fault Handling**: Messages that fail are retried automatically based on defined rules in the configuration.
- **RBAC Integration**: User entitlements determine the rate of message handling (e.g., freemium users have lower throughput limits than enterprise users).
- **Speculative Workflows**: Allows cloning of message contexts for speculative processing.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time rebalancing of priorities based on dynamic system conditions.
- Integration with external message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for distributed queuing.
