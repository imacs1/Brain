### **Overview**
The queuing system in Project Brain enables efficient processing of messages and tasks through priority-based routing and dynamic scaling mechanisms. Integrated with RBAC and the Load Balancer, the queuing system ensures optimal resource utilization and fairness among users.

### **Core Features**
1. **Priority-Based Queues**:
   - Messages are categorized into `Override`, `High`, `Medium`, and `Low` priorities.
   - Queues process messages in a defined ratio:
     - `Override`: 100% until the queue is empty.
     - Remaining priorities processed in a 6:3:1 ratio for `High:Medium:Low`.

2. **Dynamic Scaling**:
   - Monitors queue length and adjusts the number of processing instances accordingly.
   - Balances between underutilization and overcommitment of resources.

3. **RBAC Integration**:
   - Users are assigned quotas (e.g., free, standard, enterprise).
   - Priorities and access limits are enforced through the `QuotaManager`.

4. **Fairness and Efficiency**:
   - Ensures no priority queue starves others.
   - Allows backpressure mechanisms to prevent system overloads.

### **Implementation Details**
1. **Priority Distribution**:
   - Implemented using weighted round-robin.
   - Example: For every 10 messages, 6 are taken from the `High` queue, 3 from `Medium`, and 1 from `Low`.

2. **Queue Structure**:
   - Each priority has its own queue managed by the Load Balancer.
   - Separate metrics for queue lengths, wait times, and throughput.

3. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Dynamic monitoring of queues for real-time adjustment.
   - Integrated heartbeat mechanism ensures that queue handlers are live and responsive.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Messages that fail processing are moved to a dead-letter queue.
   - Automatic retries based on configuration settings.

5. **Integration with Load Balancer**:
   - Queues are assigned to processing instances using load-balancing rules.
   - Override priority messages are routed to the fastest available instance.

### **Design Principles**
1. **Scalability**:
   - Supports horizontal scaling for high workloads.
   - Efficient use of resources during low activity.

2. **Fair Resource Distribution**:
   - Balances user entitlements with system load.
   - Dynamically throttles or boosts resources based on quotas and priorities.

3. **Transparency**:
   - Provides visibility into queue states via monitoring tools.
   - Logs all queuing events for auditability.

### **Future Enhancements**
- Implement AI-driven queue prioritization based on historical trends.
- Enhance monitoring dashboards with predictive analytics.
- Support for speculative workflows directly in the queuing system.
