### **Overview**
The Quota Manager in Project Brain ensures fair resource allocation and usage tracking across different user tiers (freemium, standard, enterprise). It implements RBAC-based throttling and quota enforcement to prevent resource overuse and ensure system stability.

### **Core Responsibilities**
1. **Quota Enforcement**:
   - Applies per-user or per-role usage limits on API calls, workflows, and actions.
   - Supports dynamic scaling of quotas based on subscription tiers or system capacity.

2. **RBAC Throttling**:
   - Integrates with the RBAC system to define tier-specific usage rules.
   - Implements time-based access limits for workflows and services.

3. **Usage Tracking**:
   - Tracks usage metrics for users and workflows in real-time.
   - Stores historical data for auditing and reporting.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - Adjusts quotas dynamically based on load, system capacity, or user upgrades.
   - Collaborates with the Load Balancer and Monitor for adaptive scaling.

5. **Alerting and Notifications**:
   - Notifies users or administrators when quotas are nearing limits.
   - Sends alerts for violations or anomalous usage patterns.

### **Key Features**
1. **Tier-Based Quotas**:
   - Freemium: Low quota limits, access to basic features.
   - Standard: Moderate quotas with premium feature access.
   - Enterprise: High quotas, priority access, and advanced features.

2. **Real-Time Throttling**:
   - Enforces quotas dynamically during message processing.
   - Prevents overuse by delaying or rejecting requests exceeding limits.

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - Logs all usage data with GUIDs for traceability.
   - Provides insights into user behavior and system usage trends.

4. **Customizable Limits**:
   - Allows administrators to define custom quotas per user, role, or workflow.
   - Supports time-bound rules (e.g., 100 API calls/hour).

5. **Integration with Cost Tracking**:
   - Maps token costs to usage for billing and audit purposes.
   - Collaborates with the Cost Manager to ensure transparency.

### **Service Workflow**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Loads quota rules from encrypted configuration files.
   - Registers with the Monitor for real-time updates on load and capacity.

2. **Request Validation**:
   - Validates incoming requests against user quotas.
   - Applies throttling or rejection if limits are exceeded.

3. **Usage Updates**:
   - Updates usage metrics in real-time for active sessions.
   - Stores metrics in the database for historical analysis.

4. **Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Sends alerts for quota breaches or anomalies.
   - Notifies users of impending quota limits and provides upgrade options.

### **Example JSON Configuration**
json
{
    "quota_manager": {
        "tiers": {
            "freemium": {
                "api_calls_per_hour": 10,
                "priority": "low"
            },
            "standard": {
                "api_calls_per_hour": 100,
                "priority": "medium"
            },
            "enterprise": {
                "api_calls_per_hour": 500,
                "priority": "high"
            }
        },
        "alerts": {
            "enabled": true,
            "threshold_percentage": 90,
            "channels": ["email", "dashboard"]
        }
    }
}

2. **Transaction Workflow**:
   - Before processing an action:
     1. Check the user's token balance.
     2. Deduct tokens if sufficient balance exists.
     3. Reject the request if the balance is insufficient.

3. **Throttling**:
   - Implements dynamic throttling based on quotas and system load.
   - Prioritizes high-tier users and critical workflows during peak demand.

4. **Integration with Cost Tracking**:
   - Works seamlessly with the token-based cost system to enforce usage limits.
   - Example:
     - Translate (5 tokens/1000 words)
     - Summarize (2 tokens/1000 words)

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Provides meaningful responses for quota breaches:
     - Warning: "Approaching daily limit."
     - Rejection: "Quota exceeded. Upgrade your plan or wait for the reset."

### **Key Benefits**

- **Fair Resource Allocation**:
  - Prevents abuse and ensures equitable access to services.

- **Scalability**:
  - Supports unlimited users and dynamic quota adjustments.

- **Proactive Monitoring**:
  - Detects and prevents overuse or potential exploitation.

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Predictive Quota Adjustment**:
   - Machine learning models to adjust quotas dynamically based on usage patterns.

2. **Quota Sharing**:
   - Allow groups or teams to share token balances.

3. **API for External Access**:
   - Enable external platforms to query and manage quotas programmatically.
