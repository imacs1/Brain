### **Quota Manager Overview**

The Quota Manager in Project Brain ensures fair and efficient usage of system resources by tracking and enforcing token limits for actions, workflows, and messages. It integrates with the RBAC system for user-specific quotas and supports proactive throttling and resource allocation.

---

### **Core Features**

1. **Token Balances**:
   - Tracks token balances for all users and services.
   - Ensures transactions are within allowed quotas.

2. **Quota Enforcement**:
   - Supports tiered quotas for user types (e.g., free, standard, enterprise).
   - Enforces soft limits (warnings) and hard limits (rejections).

3. **RBAC Integration**:
   - Dynamically applies quotas based on user roles and entitlements.
   - Example: Free users = 100 tokens/day, Standard users = 500 tokens/day.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitors token usage and generates alerts for breaches or unusual activity.

5. **Flexible Quota Reset**:
   - Resets quotas based on predefined schedules (daily, monthly) or custom rules.

6. **Audit Trails**:
   - Logs every transaction with GUIDs, token usage, and associated user/service details.

### **Implementation Details**

1. **Token Allocation**:
   - Tokens are allocated during user registration or service initialization.
   - Example: `quota_config.json`
     ```json
     {
       "users": {
         "free": { "daily_limit": 100 },
         "standard": { "daily_limit": 500 },
         "enterprise": { "daily_limit": "unlimited" }
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Transaction Workflow**:
   - Before processing an action:
     1. Check the user's token balance.
     2. Deduct tokens if sufficient balance exists.
     3. Reject the request if the balance is insufficient.

3. **Throttling**:
   - Implements dynamic throttling based on quotas and system load.
   - Prioritizes high-tier users and critical workflows during peak demand.

4. **Integration with Cost Tracking**:
   - Works seamlessly with the token-based cost system to enforce usage limits.
   - Example:
     - Translate (5 tokens/1000 words)
     - Summarize (2 tokens/1000 words)

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Provides meaningful responses for quota breaches:
     - Warning: "Approaching daily limit."
     - Rejection: "Quota exceeded. Upgrade your plan or wait for the reset."

### **Key Benefits**

- **Fair Resource Allocation**:
  - Prevents abuse and ensures equitable access to services.

- **Scalability**:
  - Supports unlimited users and dynamic quota adjustments.

- **Proactive Monitoring**:
  - Detects and prevents overuse or potential exploitation.

---

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Predictive Quota Adjustment**:
   - Machine learning models to adjust quotas dynamically based on usage patterns.

2. **Quota Sharing**:
   - Allow groups or teams to share token balances.

3. **API for External Access**:
   - Enable external platforms to query and manage quotas programmatically.
