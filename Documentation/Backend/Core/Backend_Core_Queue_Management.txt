# Queue Management and Queue Manager Overview

## Core Features

### 1. Priority-Based Queuing
- Messages are classified into four levels:
  - **Override**: Immediate processing with 100% resource allocation.
  - **High**: 60% of remaining resources.
  - **Medium**: 30% of remaining resources.
  - **Low**: 10% of remaining resources.
- Weighted algorithms ensure consistent throughput across all priorities.

### 2. Dynamic Resource Allocation
- Resources dynamically adjust based on queue metrics and system health.
- Override tasks always take precedence, while remaining tasks follow a 6:3:1 ratio.

### 3. Fault Tolerance
- Failed messages are retried based on retry policies.
- Persistent failures move to a dead-letter queue for inspection.

### 4. Queue Isolation and Monitoring
- Priority queues are isolated to prevent blocking.
- Metrics such as queue lengths, throughput, and error rates are monitored.

### 5. RBAC and Quota Integration
- Ensures user compliance with roles, entitlements, and quotas.
- Integrates with Quota Manager for fine-grained throttling.

## Queue Manager Responsibilities

1. **Message Prioritization**:
   - Classifies and processes messages based on priority definitions.

2. **Dynamic Scaling**:
   - Allocates processing capacity dynamically based on workload.

3. **Dead-Letter Handling**:
   - Provides inspection, retry, and deletion for unprocessable messages.

4. **Integration with Load Balancer**:
   - Ensures optimal message routing to instances.

5. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Generates metrics for dashboards and real-time alerts.

## Example JSON Configuration

{
    "queue_manager": {
        "priority_ratios": {
            "high": 6,
            "medium": 3,
            "low": 1
        },
        "retry_policy": {
            "max_retries": 5,
            "retry_interval_ms": 1000
        },
        "dead_letter_queue": {
            "enabled": true,
            "retention_period_days": 7
        }
    }
}

## Future Enhancements
1. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - Use AI for queue load balancing and optimization.

2. **Advanced Error Recovery**:
   - Automated workflows to handle complex dead-letter issues.

3. **External Queuing Integration**:
   - Support distributed systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring Dashboards**:
   - Real-time visualizations for queue and performance metrics.
