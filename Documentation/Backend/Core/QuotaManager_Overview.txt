### **Overview**
The QuotaManager is a critical component of Project Brain, designed to enforce resource usage limits at multiple levels (e.g., user, role, service). It integrates with the load balancer and RBAC system to ensure fair allocation of resources, prevent abuse, and maintain system stability.

### **Core Features**

1. **Per-User and Role-Based Quotas**:
   - Defines usage limits for different user tiers (freemium, standard, enterprise).
   - Enforces quotas on actions, workflows, and API calls.

2. **Time-Based Tracking**:
   - Tracks usage over defined intervals (e.g., per hour, per day).
   - Supports configurable reset periods for quotas.

3. **Integration with RBAC**:
   - Aligns quotas with user roles and access policies.
   - Supports dynamic adjustments based on role changes.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Monitors resource usage in real-time to detect and prevent violations.
   - Provides alerts when usage approaches defined limits.

5. **Dynamic Scaling Support**:
   - Collaborates with the load balancer to allocate resources efficiently.
   - Prevents over-provisioning by throttling requests.

6. **Audit and Reporting**:
   - Logs quota usage for auditing and compliance.
   - Generates reports for administrators to review trends and anomalies.

### **Key Components**

1. **Quota Rules Engine**:
   - Defines and evaluates rules for resource usage.
   - Supports flexible configurations (e.g., API calls per hour, storage limits).

2. **Usage Tracker**:
   - Tracks real-time usage across users, roles, and services.
   - Stores historical data for analysis and reporting.

3. **Violation Handler**:
   - Handles quota breaches by throttling or rejecting requests.
   - Integrates with the logger to record violations.

4. **Admin API**:
   - Provides programmatic access to quota settings and usage data.
   - Allows administrators to adjust limits dynamically.

---

### **Workflow**

1. **Request Evaluation**:
   - Each request is evaluated against the user's current quota.
   - Violations trigger alerts or throttling mechanisms.

2. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Usage data is updated in real-time to ensure accuracy.
   - Supports concurrent tracking across multiple services.

3. **Quota Enforcement**:
   - Actions exceeding quotas are blocked or delayed.
   - Users receive feedback on their current usage and remaining quota.

4. **Scaling Decisions**:
   - Collaborates with the load balancer to adjust resources as needed.
   - Ensures that system stability is prioritized during high demand.

---

### **Example Use Case**

#### **Scenario: API Rate Limiting**
1. **Setup**:
   - Freemium users: 10 calls/hour.
   - Standard users: 100 calls/hour.
   - Enterprise users: 500 calls/hour.

2. **Processing**:
   - QuotaManager tracks API calls in real-time.
   - Requests exceeding limits are rejected with an error response.

3. **Alerts**:
   - When usage reaches 90% of the limit, users receive a warning.
   - Administrators are notified of potential abuse.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Monthly usage reports are generated for review.

---

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Predictive Quota Adjustments**:
   - Uses AI to predict future usage and adjust quotas dynamically.

2. **Advanced Role Customization**:
   - Supports granular quota definitions for sub-roles or temporary access.

3. **Global Quota Enforcement**:
   - Extends tracking and enforcement across multi-region deployments.

4. **Integration with Cost Tracking**:
   - Links usage data with token-based cost tracking for billing.

---

### **Conclusion**
The QuotaManager ensures that resources are used fairly and efficiently across the system. Its integration with the load balancer, RBAC, and logging services makes it an indispensable component of Project Brain.
