# Authentication and Authorization (Auth)

## Overview
The authentication and authorization system in Project Brain is built to enforce secure, role-based access control (RBAC) for users and services while supporting dynamic and time-sensitive access policies.

## Core Features

1. **RBAC Integration**
   - Users and services are assigned roles with predefined permissions.
   - Roles include:
     - **Admin**: Full access to all actions and services.
     - **Standard**: Limited access to core services and workflows.
     - **Guest**: Restricted access with read-only permissions.

2. **Time-Based Access**
   - Access can be restricted to specific time windows using RBAC rules.
   - Example: A user role may only access certain actions during business hours.

3. **OAuth 2.0**
   - Enables secure user authentication via third-party providers.
   - OAuth tokens are validated for API requests.

4. **Dynamic Configuration**
   - Auth rules are stored in `auth_config.json` and can be dynamically updated.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "roles": {
         "admin": ["read", "write", "manage"],
         "standard": ["read", "write"],
         "guest": ["read"]
       },
       "time_based_access": {
         "standard": {
           "start_time": "09:00",
           "end_time": "17:00"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

## Integration with Other Components

- **Queue Management**:
  - RBAC rules determine who can enqueue messages or manage priority.
- **Workflows**:
  - Workflows enforce role permissions for each step.
- **Context Management**:
  - Access to context data is restricted by roles and permissions.

## Security Mechanisms

1. **Token Expiry**
   - OAuth tokens include expiration times and are validated against the configured time limits.

2. **Encryption**
   - Auth data is stored securely using LibSodium encryption.

3. **Audit Logs**
   - All authentication and authorization activities are logged for audit purposes.

## Error Handling

- Unauthorized access attempts result in detailed error logs and alerts.
- Temporary bans are enforced for repeated unauthorized attempts.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Real-time alerts for suspicious login attempts.
- Advanced analytics for RBAC rule optimization.
