### **Message Handling**

Messages are the primary means of communication in Project Brain, facilitating interaction between services, workflows, and end-users.

---

### **Core Features**

1. **Message Structure**:
   - Messages have a standardized format:
     ```json
     {
       "messageId": "abcdef-12345",
       "type": "MSG_TRANSLATE",
       "payload": {
           "text": "Hello, world!",
           "language": "es"
       },
       "priority": "High",
       "rbac": {
           "role": "Enterprise",
           "timeWindow": "2024-12-31T00:00:00Z/2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
       },
       "guid": "12345-67890"
     }
     ```

2. **Message Prioritization**:
   - Priority levels: Override, High, Medium, Low.
   - Messages are queued in priority-based queues:
     - Override messages are processed exclusively until complete.
     - High, Medium, and Low are processed in a 6:3:1 ratio.

3. **Dynamic Routing**:
   - Messages are routed based on handlers determined at runtime using reflection.
   - Example: `MSG_TRANSLATE` invokes `ActionService` to call `PerformTranslation`.

4. **Cost Tracking**:
   - Each message tracks associated costs for transparency and billing.

---

### **Message Lifecycle**

1. **Generation**:
   - Messages are generated by workflows, user actions, or external integrations.

2. **Queuing**:
   - Messages are queued according to priority and service availability.

3. **Routing**:
   - Routing tables direct messages to appropriate services or workflows.

4. **Processing**:
   - Handlers execute message payloads, update states, and return responses.

5. **Completion**:
   - Results are logged, and messages are marked as complete.

---

### **Integration Points**

1. **Workflows**:
   - Workflows use messages to trigger actions and track progress.

2. **Load Balancer**:
   - The load balancer ensures optimal routing and service utilization.

3. **RBAC and Throttling**:
   - Message execution is controlled by RBAC policies and quota limits.

---

### **Error Handling**

1. **Retry Logic**:
   - Failed messages are retried based on configured policies.

2. **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**:
   - Unrecoverable messages are moved to the DLQ for manual review.

3. **Logging**:
   - Comprehensive logs capture message states and errors.

---

### **Security**

1. **Encryption**:
   - Messages are encrypted during transmission and storage.

2. **RBAC Enforcement**:
   - Message execution checks roles, permissions, and time-based access.

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - GUIDs provide a complete execution history.

---

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **AI-Driven Message Prioritization**:
   - Use AI to dynamically adjust priorities based on context.

2. **Distributed Message Processing**:
   - Expand support for external messaging systems (e.g., RabbitMQ).

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Add dashboards to visualize message flows and bottlenecks.
