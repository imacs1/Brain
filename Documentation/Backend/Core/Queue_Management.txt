# Queue Management

## Overview
The queue management system in Project Brain ensures fair and efficient processing of messages based on dynamic priority rules.

## Core Features

1. **Priority-Based Queuing**
   - Messages are classified into four priority levels:
     - **Override**: 100% processing priority until the queue is cleared.
     - **High**: 60% of remaining messages processed.
     - **Medium**: 30% of remaining messages processed.
     - **Low**: 10% of remaining messages processed.
   - A weighted queue processing algorithm ensures consistent throughput for all priorities.

2. **Dynamic Rebalancing**
   - Queues dynamically adjust to accommodate real-time changes in message priorities or system load.

3. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Failed messages are retried or moved to a dead-letter queue for manual intervention.

4. **Integration with Load Balancer**
   - High-priority messages are routed to the fastest available servers for quicker processing.

## Workflow Example

1. Messages are added to priority-based queues.
2. The `QueueManager` service processes override messages first.
3. Remaining messages are processed based on the 6:3:1 ratio for high, medium, and low priorities.
4. Processed messages are removed from the queue, and any errors are logged.

## Configuration Example

- Priority definitions and processing rules are stored in `queue_config.json`.
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "priorities": {
      "override": { "weight": 100 },
      "high": { "weight": 60 },
      "medium": { "weight": 30 },
      "low": { "weight": 10 }
    },
    "retry_policy": {
      "max_retries": 3,
      "retry_interval": 1000
    }
  }
### Fault Handling
  1. Retries:
    a) Failed messages are retried up to the maximum retry count.
    b) Retry intervals are defined in the configuration.

  2. Dead-Letter Queue:
    a) Messages that consistently fail are moved to a dead-letter queue for manual intervention.

### Future Enhancements
  a) Predictive queue balancing using AI to optimize message processing.
  b) Real-time visualization of queue status and metrics.
  c) Advanced error recovery mechanisms for complex workflows.
