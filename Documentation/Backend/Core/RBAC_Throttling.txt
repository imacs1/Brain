# RBAC Throttling

## Overview
RBAC throttling in Project Brain enforces equitable resource allocation and prevents abuse by dynamically applying limits based on user roles and entitlements.

## Core Features

1. **Dynamic Throttling**
   - Limits are applied to API calls, message handling, and other resource-intensive tasks based on user role.
   - Example limits:
     - **Freemium Users**: 10 API calls per hour.
     - **Standard Users**: 100 API calls per hour.
     - **Enterprise Users**: 500 API calls per hour.

2. **Time-Based Access**
   - Time-based RBAC rules allow users to access resources during predefined periods.
   - Example: "Enterprise users can access premium workflows only during business hours."

3. **Quota Management**
   - Each user or service has a quota defined in the configuration.
   - Quota violations trigger alerts and temporarily suspend access.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Live metrics track usage against quotas for each role and user.
   - Alerts are generated for anomalies or when nearing quota limits.

5. **Integration with Load Balancer**
   - RBAC rules dynamically influence load balancing decisions to prioritize high-value users.

## Implementation Details

- **Configuration**:
  - Limits and roles are defined in the `auth_config.json` file.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "roles": {
        "freemium": { "api_limit": 10 },
        "standard": { "api_limit": 100 },
        "enterprise": { "api_limit": 500 }
      }
    }
    ```

- **Enforcement**:
  - The `QuotaManager` service validates requests against RBAC rules and updates quotas in real-time.
  - Violations are logged for audit purposes.

- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Requests that exceed limits are gracefully rejected with an appropriate error response.

## Workflow Example

1. A user initiates an API request.
2. The `QuotaManager` checks the user's role and current usage.
3. If within limits, the request is processed.
4. If limits are exceeded, the request is rejected with a "Rate Limit Exceeded" message.

## Future Enhancements

- Adaptive throttling based on system load and resource availability.
- Predictive analytics to adjust quotas dynamically based on usage trends.
- Integration with third-party identity providers for extended RBAC capabilities.
