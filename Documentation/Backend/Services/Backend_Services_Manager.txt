# Backend Services: Manager

## Overview
The Manager service oversees the lifecycle of all backend services, ensuring dynamic updates to routing tables and monitoring service health. It plays a central role in maintaining system stability and scalability.

## Key Features
1. **Service Lifecycle Management**:
   - Tracks the start, stop, and restart events of all backend services.
   - Dynamically updates routing tables when services are added or removed.

2. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Monitors service health through periodic heartbeats and diagnostics.
   - Identifies failing services and triggers automated recovery mechanisms.

3. **Dynamic Routing Updates**:
   - Ensures routing tables reflect the latest service availability and configurations.
   - Coordinates with the LoadBalancer for optimal resource allocation.

4. **Scalability Support**:
   - Facilitates horizontal scaling by registering new service instances dynamically.
   - Ensures consistent load distribution across available resources.

5. **Error Tracking**:
   - Logs and reports errors related to service interactions and lifecycle events.
   - Collaborates with the Monitor service for detailed fault analysis.

## Service Lifecycle
1. **Registration**:
   - Services register with the Manager during initialization.
   - Routing tables are updated to include the new service.

2. **Heartbeat Monitoring**:
   - Periodically checks service availability through heartbeat messages.
   - Flags unresponsive services for recovery or manual intervention.

3. **Routing Table Updates**:
   - Updates routing tables dynamically based on service health and load conditions.
   - Ensures seamless service interactions without manual reconfiguration.

4. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Automatically restarts failed services when possible.
   - Logs detailed reports for further investigation.

## Integration
- **LoadBalancer**:
  - Works closely to optimize resource utilization based on routing table updates.
- **Monitor**:
  - Collaborates to analyze service health and performance metrics.
- **Logger**:
  - Tracks lifecycle events and errors for audit and debugging purposes.

## Configuration
- Configuration files for the Manager service are stored in `Config/Services`.
- Includes:
  - Routing policies and rules.
  - Health check intervals and thresholds.
  - Recovery strategies and notifications.

## Testing
The Manager service is rigorously tested to ensure stability:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Validates lifecycle event handling and routing table updates.
2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Ensures compatibility with services like Monitor and LoadBalancer.
3. **Functional Tests**:
   - Simulates service failures and scaling scenarios to verify recovery mechanisms.
