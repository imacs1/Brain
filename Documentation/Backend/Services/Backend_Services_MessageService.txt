# Backend Services: MessageService

## Overview
The MessageService facilitates seamless communication between backend services and the user interface. It prioritizes messages, manages message lifecycles, and tracks errors for analysis and resolution.

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time Message Prioritization**:
   - Sorts messages based on urgency and user entitlement (e.g., free, paid, enterprise).
   - Ensures high-priority messages are processed first in accordance with system policies.

2. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Tracks the full lifecycle of messages, from creation to resolution.
   - Logs timestamps, statuses, and outcomes for each message.

3. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Monitors message exchanges for errors and ensures they are logged independently.
   - Integrates with the Logger and Monitor services for downstream analysis.

4. **Dynamic Routing**:
   - Routes messages dynamically to appropriate services based on predefined rules and runtime conditions.
   - Ensures routing tables remain up-to-date through integration with the Manager service.

## Message Lifecycle
1. **Creation**:
   - Messages are created dynamically based on incoming requests or system-generated events.

2. **Prioritization**:
   - Assigns priority levels using predefined rules or user-specific configurations.
   - Routes high-priority messages to the LoadBalancer for immediate processing.

3. **Execution**:
   - Delivers messages to their intended destinations using routing tables.
   - Supports retries and alternate routing in case of failures.

4. **Tracking**:
   - Logs detailed information about message statuses (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed).

5. **Error Resolution**:
   - Flags errors in message exchanges for further investigation by the Monitor service.

## Integration
- **LoadBalancer**:
  - Works closely to enforce prioritization and ensure optimal resource utilization.
- **Logger**:
  - Tracks the lifecycle of messages and provides detailed audit trails.
- **Monitor**:
  - Analyzes errors and performance bottlenecks.
- **Manager**:
  - Updates routing tables dynamically based on service availability.

## Configuration
- Configurations for the MessageService are stored in `Config/Messages`.
- Includes rules for prioritization, routing, and error handling.

## Testing
The MessageService is validated using:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Ensures correct message creation, routing, and prioritization.
2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Validates communication with other backend services (e.g., LoadBalancer, Logger).
3. **Functional Tests**:
   - Simulates real-world scenarios to verify end-to-end message handling.
