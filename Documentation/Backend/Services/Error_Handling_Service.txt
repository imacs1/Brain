# Error Handling Service Documentation

## Overview

The Error Handling Service centralizes error detection, logging, and resolution within Project Brain. It ensures consistency in handling errors across all components while enabling detailed tracking and escalation.

## Key Features

1. **ErrorRegistry**:
   - Tracks all errors with detailed metadata.
   - Provides insights for error resolution and analysis.

2. **Retry and Escalation**:
   - Automatically retries transient errors based on configured policies.
   - Escalates unresolved errors for manual intervention.

3. **Integration with Logger**:
   - Logs errors with detailed context for debugging.
   - Utilizes the Logger for critical error notifications.

4. **Self-Healing Mechanisms**:
   - Proactive error detection and automated resolutions.
   - Integration with monitoring services for real-time fixes.

## Configuration

### Configuration File Example:
```json
{
  "ErrorHandling": {
    "RetryPolicy": {
      "MaxRetries": 5,
      "RetryIntervalMs": 1000
    },
    "EscalationThreshold": 3,
    "EnableLogging": true
  }
}
Integration Points
Logger Service:

Logs all errors for tracking and alerts.
Monitoring Services:

Provides real-time insights for unresolved errors.
Action Services:

Utilized by individual services to handle internal errors.
Example Workflow
Error Detection:

A service detects a network failure and reports it to the ErrorRegistry.
Retry Logic:

The Error Handling Service retries the operation based on the configured policy.
Escalation:

If retries fail, the error is escalated and logged as critical.
Future Enhancements
Error visualization dashboards.
Predictive error analysis using machine learning.
Integration with external issue tracking systems.
