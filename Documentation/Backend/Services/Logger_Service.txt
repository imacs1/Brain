# Logger Service Documentation

## Overview

The Logger Service records system events, status updates, and errors across all services in Project Brain. It operates as a centralized service to ensure consistency and extensibility in logging.

## Key Features

1. **Centralized Logging**:
   - Records all logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
   - Supports multiple destinations (e.g., files, databases, and real-time monitoring tools).

2. **Levels of Logging**:
   - **Info**: General system activity.
   - **Debug**: Detailed information for debugging.
   - **Warning**: Non-critical issues.
   - **Error**: Critical errors needing immediate attention.

3. **Integration with Error Handling**:
   - Logs errors reported by the **ErrorRegistry**.
   - Triggers error analysis pipelines for critical logs.

4. **Alerting Mechanism**:
   - Sends notifications for critical events (e.g., email, Slack).
   - Configurable thresholds for alerts.
