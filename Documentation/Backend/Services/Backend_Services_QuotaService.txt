# Backend Services: Quota Service

## Overview
The Quota Service is responsible for monitoring, enforcing, and managing quotas for users and system resources. It ensures fair resource allocation, prevents abuse, and enables efficient operation of the system by adhering to defined consumption limits.

---

## Key Features
1. **Quota Definition and Enforcement**:
   - Supports defining quotas at various levels:
     - User-level (e.g., free vs. paid users).
     - System-level (e.g., total API requests per hour).
   - Enforces quotas in real-time, rejecting requests that exceed limits.

2. **Dynamic Quota Adjustment**:
   - Allows dynamic quota changes based on user entitlements, system policies, or temporary overrides (e.g., promotional events).

3. **Consumption Tracking**:
   - Tracks usage metrics, such as API calls, data processed, and storage consumed, for individual users and system-wide.

4. **Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Sends alerts to users and administrators when quotas are nearing or have exceeded defined thresholds.

5. **Quota Reports**:
   - Generates periodic reports on quota utilization for analytics and billing purposes.

---

## Structure
The Quota Service includes:
1. **Quota Manager**:
   - Core component for defining, storing, and enforcing quotas.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public class QuotaManager
     {
         public Task<bool> CheckQuotaAsync(string userId, string resourceType, int usage);
         public Task UpdateQuotaAsync(string userId, string resourceType, int newQuota);
     }
     ```

2. **Tracking Module**:
   - Tracks real-time consumption metrics and maintains historical data for reporting.

3. **Alerts and Notifications Module**:
   - Monitors usage thresholds and triggers alerts when required.

4. **Reporting Module**:
   - Provides detailed insights into quota utilization via reports.

---

## Integration
1. **System-wide Integration**:
   - The Quota Service is integrated with other services to monitor and enforce resource usage limits dynamically.

2. **API Support**:
   - Exposes endpoints for managing and querying quotas, such as:
     - `/api/quota/check`
     - `/api/quota/update`
     - `/api/quota/report`

3. **RBAC Integration**:
   - Ensures quotas are aligned with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies.

---

## Example Workflow
1. **Quota Check**:
   - A service requests a quota check before processing a user request:
     ```json
     {
         "userId": "12345",
         "resourceType": "API_CALLS",
         "usage": 1
     }
     ```
   - The Quota Service validates the request and returns:
     - `"allowed": true` if within the quota.
     - `"allowed": false` with an appropriate message otherwise.

2. **Quota Update**:
   - Adjust quotas dynamically for specific users or resource types as policies change.

3. **Alerts**:
   - Notify users when 90% of their quota is consumed:
     - `"Your API call quota is nearing its limit."`

---

## Error Handling
1. **Exceeding Quotas**:
   - Returns descriptive errors for quota violations.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "error": "QuotaExceeded",
         "message": "You have exceeded your API call quota for this month."
     }
     ```

2. **System Failures**:
   - Logs failures in the Quota Service to ensure they are resolved promptly.

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Uses default quotas for users if quota records are unavailable.

---

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Validate quota enforcement logic with different scenarios.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Ensure the Quota Service interacts correctly with other system components.
- **Load Tests**:
  - Assess performance under heavy usage to ensure scalability.
