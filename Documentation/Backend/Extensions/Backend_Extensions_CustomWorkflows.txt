# Backend Extensions: Custom Workflows

## Overview
Custom Workflows extend the system's functionality by enabling users and developers to define bespoke workflows tailored to specific business or operational needs. These workflows are extensively used in content creation processes and integrate seamlessly with the core engine while maintaining flexibility and configurability.

---

## Key Features
1. **Custom Workflow Definition**:
   - Define unique workflows using a JSON or YAML configuration format.
   - Workflows can include chaining actions, conditional branching, and dynamic parameters.

2. **Integration with Core System**:
   - Custom workflows interact with core services (e.g., routing, queuing) and leverage system capabilities like RBAC and quotas.

3. **Runtime Execution**:
   - Workflows can be dynamically executed at runtime without requiring system restarts.

4. **Content Creation Focus**:
   - Includes predefined workflows for content creation, such as:
     - `WF_BUSINESS_PLAN.json`: For drafting business plans.
     - `WF_NOVEL.json`: For structuring novel writing processes.
     - `WF_TV_SERIES.json`: For creating TV series scripts and outlines.

---

## Workflow Structure
Custom workflows consist of:
1. **Workflow Configuration**:
   - Defines the sequence of actions, parameters, and conditions.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "workflowName": "NovelWriting",
         "steps": [
             { "action": "GenerateOutline", "parameters": { "genre": "Fantasy" } },
             { "action": "CreateChapters", "parameters": { "chapterCount": 12 } },
             { "action": "ReviewAndEdit", "parameters": { "editor": "AI" } }
         ]
     }
     ```

2. **Workflow Handlers**:
   - Custom handlers can be registered to support unique actions not covered by existing services.

3. **Triggers**:
   - Define events or conditions that trigger the workflow (e.g., user input, scheduled time).

---

## Management
1. **Registration**:
   - Workflows are registered through the Workflow API or by placing configuration files in the `CustomWorkflows` directory.

2. **Version Control**:
   - Supports multiple versions of workflows for testing and rollback purposes.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Workflow execution is monitored in real time, with logs and metrics available for review.

---

## Integration
1. **API Support**:
   - Endpoints for creating, updating, and querying workflows.
   - Example: `/api/workflows/create` to register a new workflow.

2. **Content-Aware Customization**:
   - Workflows are dynamically tailored to user needs, such as drafting different content types or enforcing style guides.

---

## Error Handling
1. **Validation**:
   - Workflows are validated against the schema during registration.
   - Invalid workflows are rejected with detailed error messages.

2. **Fallbacks**:
   - In case of failures, workflows revert to the last successful step or retry based on predefined rules.

---

## Example Use Cases
1. **ETL Pipelines**:
   - Create workflows for extracting, transforming, and loading data into storage systems.
2. **Content Creation**:
   - Automate structured content creation for novels, TV series, and business plans.

---

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Validate individual workflow steps and configurations.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test end-to-end execution of workflows in a controlled environment.
