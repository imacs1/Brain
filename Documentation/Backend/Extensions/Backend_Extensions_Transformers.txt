# Backend Extensions: Transformers

## Overview
Transformers are specialized components in the backend extensions designed to manipulate, process, and standardize data as it flows through workflows. They ensure data consistency and prepare it for downstream tasks, enabling seamless integration between services.

---

## Key Features
1. **Data Transformation**:
   - Transformers modify input data to match the expected format of downstream components.
   - Examples include data parsing, enrichment, and format conversions (e.g., JSON to XML).

2. **Support for Multiple Data Types**:
   - Transformers handle diverse data types, such as text, structured data, and multimedia files.

3. **Integration with Workflows**:
   - Transformers are embedded as steps within workflows, ensuring real-time data manipulation during execution.

4. **Customizable Logic**:
   - Developers can create custom transformers for domain-specific transformations.

---

## Structure
Transformers are composed of the following components:
1. **Transformer Interface**:
   - Defines the standard methods and properties for all transformers.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public interface ITransformer
     {
         string Name { get; }
         Task<object> TransformAsync(object input, Context context);
     }
     ```

2. **Implementation**:
   - Implements the transformation logic, tailored to specific use cases.
   - Example: A transformer that formats dates.
     ```csharp
     public class DateFormatter : ITransformer
     {
         public string Name => "DateFormatter";
         public async Task<object> TransformAsync(object input, Context context)
         {
             // Logic to format dates
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Transformers can use configuration files for reusable settings.

---

## Management
1. **Registration**:
   - Transformers are stored in the `Extensions/Transformers` directory and auto-registered at runtime.

2. **Version Control**:
   - Supports versioned transformers to maintain compatibility with workflows.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Logs transformation details and execution times for diagnostics.

---

## Integration
1. **Workflow Engine**:
   - Transformers are invoked by the workflow engine to process data during execution.

2. **API Support**:
   - Endpoints for managing transformers, such as uploading or querying available transformers.

---

## Error Handling
1. **Validation**:
   - Transformers validate input data before processing.
   - Invalid input triggers detailed error logs and workflow fallbacks.

2. **Error Isolation**:
   - Errors in a transformer are contained to avoid disrupting other workflow steps.

---

## Example Use Cases
1. **Data Normalization**:
   - Transformers to standardize incoming data formats for database storage.
2. **Content Preparation**:
   - Transformers to adjust content for specific output channels (e.g., social media, blogs).

---

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Ensure transformation logic produces correct results for given inputs.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Verify transformers work correctly within the workflow context.
- **Performance Tests**:
  - Assess the efficiency of transformers under high data volumes.
