## Context Integration with External Services

### 1. Introduction
Context data in Project Brain is not limited to internal workflows. It is integrated with external services such as AI models, third-party APIs, and databases to enrich decision-making and facilitate seamless communication between systems.

### 2. Context Exchange Between Services
Context data is exchanged between services using a decoupled message-based approach. Each service can receive and modify context, ensuring that workflows and tasks are aligned across the system.

#### Example:
- **Message Flow:** A message is sent from the Workflow Service to the Translation Service with the context of the user and the task to be translated.
- **Message Handling:** The receiving service processes the context and modifies it as needed before passing it to the next service.

### 3. Context in API Integration
External services may require context data as input parameters. The context is serialized and sent as part of the API request, ensuring that the receiving service understands the state of the workflow or task.

#### Example:
- An AI service receives context containing user data and task-specific details, which are used to generate a personalized response.

### 4. Error Handling and Context Integrity
Ensuring that context remains consistent and valid across services is essential. Any errors in external service interactions (e.g., API failures) are captured, and the system attempts to recover gracefully, either by retrying or rolling back to a previous context state.

#### Example:
- If an external API fails, the system can revert to the last known valid context state, ensuring that no erroneous data is propagated.
