# Backend Libraries: Crypto

## Overview
The Crypto library is a core component of the backend that provides robust encryption, decryption, and cryptographic utilities to secure data and ensure compliance with security standards. It supports secure communication, data integrity, and sensitive information protection throughout the system.

---

## Key Features
1. **Data Encryption and Decryption**:
   - Provides AES, RSA, and hybrid cryptographic methods for securing data at rest and in transit.
   - Includes utilities for symmetric and asymmetric key generation.

2. **Secure Communication**:
   - Enables secure transmission of messages between services using TLS encryption.
   - Supports mutual authentication to verify service identities.

3. **Hashing and Data Integrity**:
   - Implements SHA-256 and SHA-3 hashing algorithms for data integrity verification.
   - Supports HMAC for tamper-proof message authentication.

4. **Key Management**:
   - Includes utilities for securely storing and rotating cryptographic keys.
   - Supports integration with hardware security modules (HSMs) and cloud key management services.

5. **Tokenization and Masking**:
   - Provides tools for tokenizing sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) and applying masking techniques.

## Structure
The Crypto library consists of:
1. **Encryption Module**:
   - Handles data encryption and decryption using symmetric and asymmetric algorithms.
   - Example API:
     ```csharp
     public string Encrypt(string data, string key);
     public string Decrypt(string encryptedData, string key);
     ```

2. **Hashing Module**:
   - Provides functions for generating and validating hashes.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public string GenerateHash(string data);
     public bool ValidateHash(string data, string hash);
     ```

3. **Key Management Module**:
   - Includes functions for key generation, rotation, and retrieval.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public string GenerateKey();
     public void RotateKey(string keyId);
     ```

4. **Utilities Module**:
   - Includes random number generation, secure token creation, and base64 encoding/decoding.

---

## Integration
1. **System-wide Security**:
   - The Crypto library is integrated across all services to secure sensitive operations.
   - Example: Encrypting workflow data before storage.

2. **API Integration**:
   - Exposes endpoints for cryptographic operations, such as:
     - `/api/crypto/encrypt`
     - `/api/crypto/decrypt`

---

## Error Handling
1. **Invalid Input**:
   - Logs and rejects operations with malformed or missing data.
2. **Key Errors**:
   - Alerts system administrators if a key is missing, expired, or invalid.

---

## Example Use Cases
1. **Secure Workflow Execution**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data processed in workflows, such as user credentials.
2. **Message Authentication**:
   - Apply HMAC to verify the integrity of messages exchanged between services.

---

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Validate encryption, decryption, and hashing outputs for known inputs.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Ensure compatibility with other system components, such as key management and secure APIs.
- **Security Tests**:
  - Test resistance to common attacks, such as brute force and replay attacks.
