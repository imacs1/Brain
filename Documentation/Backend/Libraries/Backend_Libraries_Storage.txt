# Backend Libraries: Storage

## Overview
The Storage library provides a unified interface for managing data storage and retrieval across various backends. It supports multiple storage systems, including file-based, relational databases, cloud storage solutions, and user cloud services like OneDrive, Dropbox, and iCloud. This ensures seamless data persistence, scalability, and user convenience.

---

## Key Features
1. **Multi-Storage System Support**:
   - Integrates with local file systems, relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB), and cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob).
   - Supports user cloud services, enabling users to save and retrieve data from personal accounts on platforms like OneDrive, Dropbox, and iCloud.

2. **Unified API**:
   - Offers a consistent API for interacting with different storage backends, abstracting the underlying complexity.

3. **Data Caching**:
   - Implements caching mechanisms to optimize frequently accessed data.

4. **Encryption and Compression**:
   - Supports encrypting sensitive data and compressing large files before storage.

5. **Scalable and Fault-Tolerant**:
   - Handles large-scale data with mechanisms for retrying failed operations and ensuring data consistency.

---

## Structure
The Storage library consists of:
1. **Storage Interfaces**:
   - Defines the standard methods for storage operations.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public interface IStorage
     {
         Task SaveAsync(string key, object data);
         Task<object> RetrieveAsync(string key);
         Task DeleteAsync(string key);
     }
     ```

2. **Adapters for Specific Storage Systems**:
   - Implements the interface for various backends.
   - Examples: `FileStorageAdapter`, `DatabaseStorageAdapter`, `CloudStorageAdapter`, `UserCloudServiceAdapter`.

3. **Cache Layer**:
   - Provides a caching mechanism for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

4. **Configuration Module**:
   - Centralized management of storage configurations such as credentials, connection strings, and timeouts.

---

## Integration
1. **System-wide Use**:
   - The Storage library is utilized across all services for data persistence, such as saving workflow configurations or user data.

2. **User Cloud Service Integration**:
   - Connects to user cloud accounts via APIs provided by OneDrive, Dropbox, and iCloud.
   - Features include:
     - File upload and download.
     - Folder creation and navigation.
     - Metadata retrieval (e.g., file size, last modified date).

3. **API Support**:
   - Exposes endpoints for storage operations like uploading, downloading, and querying stored data.

4. **Error Handling Integration**:
   - Logs errors and retries operations when possible to ensure fault tolerance.

---

## Error Handling
1. **Connection Failures**:
   - Detects and logs connection issues with storage backends, including user cloud services.
   - Implements retries and fallbacks to secondary storage if available.

2. **Data Integrity Checks**:
   - Validates stored data against hashes or checksums to prevent corruption.

3. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - If a storage backend or cloud service is unavailable, switches to a temporary in-memory store.

---

## Example Use Cases
1. **Workflow Storage**:
   - Store and retrieve workflow configurations like `WF_BUSINESS_PLAN.json`.
2. **Data Archiving**:
   - Archive large datasets using cloud storage with encryption and compression.
3. **User Cloud Integration**:
   - Allow users to save exported data (e.g., generated workflows or reports) to their personal OneDrive, Dropbox, or iCloud accounts.

---

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Validate storage adapters with mock storage systems and cloud APIs.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Ensure the library interacts correctly with actual storage backends and user cloud services.
- **Performance Tests**:
  - Assess library performance with high data loads and simultaneous requests.
