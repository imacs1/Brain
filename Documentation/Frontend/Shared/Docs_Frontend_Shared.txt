# Frontend: Shared

## Overview
The Shared folder houses components and assets that are reused across the WebUI and ConsoleUI. By centralizing these elements, the system ensures consistency, reduces redundancy, and improves maintainability.

---

## Key Features
1. **Reusable Components**:
   - Shared React components used in WebUI and referenced designs for ConsoleUI.
   - Example: Buttons, input fields, and loading spinners.

2. **Shared Assets**:
   - Centralized location for images, icons, fonts, and style definitions.
   - Example: The system logo, theme definitions, and animations.

3. **Standardization**:
   - Enforces a consistent user experience across the frontend.
   - Example: Uniform styling for buttons in both WebUI and ConsoleUI.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Facilitates rapid development by providing pre-built and tested building blocks.

---

## Components
1. **Button**:
   - A versatile button component with support for multiple states (e.g., primary, secondary, disabled).
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     <Button type="primary" onClick={handleClick}>Submit</Button>
     ```

2. **Card**:
   - A container for displaying grouped information like workflow details or service statuses.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     <Card title="Workflow Details">
         <p>Status: Active</p>
     </Card>
     ```

3. **Modal**:
   - A reusable modal component for displaying alerts, forms, or other interactive content.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     <Modal isOpen={showModal} onClose={handleClose}>
         <p>Are you sure?</p>
     </Modal>
     ```

4. **Table**:
   - A component for displaying tabular data with sorting and filtering options.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     <Table data={workflowData} columns={columns} />
     ```

5. **Icon**:
   - A component for rendering SVG-based icons.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     <Icon name="check-circle" size="large" />
     ```

---

## Assets
1. **Images**:
   - Logos, background patterns, and illustrations used across the system.

2. **Icons**:
   - SVG icons for use in buttons, modals, and tables.
   - Example: Success, warning, and error icons.

3. **Fonts**:
   - Custom and standard fonts used throughout the frontend.
   - Example: Inter, Roboto.

4. **Themes**:
   - CSS or SCSS files defining the look and feel of the system, including light and dark modes.

---

## Integration
1. **WebUI**:
   - React components and shared assets are directly imported into WebUI pages and services.

2. **ConsoleUI**:
   - Shared assets like icons and fonts are referenced in the text-based ConsoleUI design.

---

## Example Use Cases
1. **Consistent Button Design**:
   - Buttons in WebUI and ConsoleUI are styled and behave identically using the shared Button component.

2. **Centralized Asset Updates**:
   - Updating the system logo in the Shared folder propagates changes across all frontend interfaces.

3. **Reusable Tables**:
   - The Table component simplifies displaying data like workflow lists or service statuses across WebUI.

---

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Validate individual shared components like buttons, cards, and modals.
2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Ensure shared components function correctly when used in WebUI and ConsoleUI.
3. **Snapshot Tests**:
   - Capture visual snapshots of shared components to detect unintended UI changes.
4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Optimize assets for quick loading and rendering.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Customizable Themes**:
   - Support for user-defined themes, extending the default light and dark modes.
2. **Asset Optimization**:
   - Automate image compression and font subsetting for faster loading.
3. **Advanced Components**:
   - Add complex shared components like drag-and-drop elements or advanced data visualization charts.
