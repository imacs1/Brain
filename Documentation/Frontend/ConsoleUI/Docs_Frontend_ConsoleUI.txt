# Frontend: ConsoleUI

## Overview
The ConsoleUI is a command-line interface (CLI) providing users with a lightweight, scriptable interface to interact with the system. It uses **DisplayLevel** as a color indicator across all UI elements to improve usability, enabling users to quickly assess the status of system components.

---

## Key Features
1. **Lightweight Interface**:
   - Minimalistic design ensures quick access to essential system operations.

2. **Scriptability**:
   - Supports automation through scripts for repetitive tasks.

3. **Color-Coded DisplayLevel Integration**:
   - DisplayLevel determines the color representation across all ConsoleUI elements:
     - **Information**: White
     - **Critical**: Purple
     - **Error**: Red
     - **Warning**: Orange

4. **Dynamic Status Representation**:
   - System components, services, and workflows are displayed with real-time status indicators based on DisplayLevel.

5. **Integration with Backend Services**:
   - Directly interfaces with backend APIs for various operations like workflow execution and quota checks.

---

## DisplayLevel-Based Color Indicators
DisplayLevel colors are applied to enhance the visibility and usability of the ConsoleUI. Examples:
1. **Logs**:
   - Entries are displayed with DisplayLevel colors:
     - `Critical`: Purple
     - `Information`: White
     - `Error`: Red
     - `Warning`: Orange

2. **Service Manager Console**:
   - Service statuses are displayed with DisplayLevel-based colors:
     - Operational: `Information` (White)
     - Down: `Critical` (Purple)
     - Errors Detected: `Warning` (Orange)

3. **Workflow Execution**:
   - Workflows can display statuses:
     - Running: `Information` (White)
     - Failed: `Critical` (Purple)
     - Warning: `Warning` (Orange)

---

## Structure
1. **Views**:
   - Renders real-time, text-based outputs like service statuses and workflow execution details.

2. **Config**:
   - Manages ConsoleUI settings, such as themes and command history size.

3. **Logs**:
   - Provides color-coded views of system logs based on DisplayLevel.

4. **Commands**:
   - Predefined and user-defined commands allow interaction with system features.

---

## Example Use Cases
1. **Service Manager Console**:
   - View and manage the status of backend services:
     ```bash
     list-services
     ```
     Example Output:
     ```
     [Information] Workflow Service: Operational (White)
     [Critical] Monitor Service: Down (Purple)
     [Warning] Logger Service: Errors Detected (Orange)
     ```

2. **Log Viewer**:
   - View logs with real-time color-coded entries:
     ```bash
     view-logs --type=error
     ```

3. **Workflow Execution**:
   - Execute workflows and monitor their status:
     ```bash
     run-workflow --name=WF_BUSINESS_PLAN
     ```
     Example Output:
     ```
     [Information] Workflow execution started. (White)
     [Warning] Workflow encountered non-critical issues. (Orange)
     [Critical] Workflow execution failed. (Purple)
     ```

4. **Quota Monitoring**:
   - Check system quotas:
     ```bash
     check-quota --user=12345
     ```

---

## Integration
1. **Backend API**:
   - Communicates with backend services to perform actions and retrieve statuses.

2. **Automation Support**:
   - Commands can be integrated into automation scripts.

---

## Error Handling
1. **Command Errors**:
   - Provides color-coded error messages when commands fail.
   - Example:
     ```
     [Error] Invalid workflow name. (Red)
     ```

2. **Log Management**:
   - Logs errors with DisplayLevel indicators for troubleshooting.

---

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Validate command execution and DisplayLevel-based display accuracy.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Ensure seamless communication with backend APIs.
- **Usability Tests**:
  - Confirm clarity and effectiveness of color-coded indicators.
- **Stress Tests**:
  - Test ConsoleUI responsiveness under high log volumes.
