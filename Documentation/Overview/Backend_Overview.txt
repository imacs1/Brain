# Backend Overview

## Introduction
The Backend of the Brain system serves as the core infrastructure, facilitating dynamic routing, data-driven workflows, and seamless integration between services. Its modular design enables flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

## Architecture
The Backend is divided into several key modules:
1. **Core**:
   - Handles fundamental operations like actions, workflows, message routing, and context management.
   - Designed for extensibility and integration with external tools.

2. **Services**:
   - Provides specialized functionality, including logging, management, monitoring, and testing.
   - Each service adheres to a common Base Service design for consistency.

3. **Extensions**:
   - Enables custom workflows, plugins, and transformers to extend system capabilities.

4. **Libraries**:
   - Includes shared utilities for encryption, storage, and common operations.

## Key Features
### Dynamic Routing
- Uses reflection and configuration files to dynamically determine handlers for actions, messages, and workflows.
- Supports real-time updates to routing tables when services start or stop.

### Speculative Workflows
- Allows chaining of actions and workflows at runtime to explore alternate execution paths.
- Fully supported by the logging, monitoring, and testing frameworks.

### Real-Time Message Prioritization
- Enforces message prioritization based on user entitlements and system policies.
- Integrated with the load balancer to ensure optimal resource utilization.

### Advanced RBAC
- Supports:
  - Time-based access controls.
  - Hierarchical roles and resource-based permissions.
  - Customizable rules for different user levels (e.g., free, paid, enterprise).

### Fault Handling and Monitoring
- Proactive fault detection with heartbeat monitoring for all services.
- Dynamic scaling adjusts service instances to meet current demand.

## Core Technologies
- **Neo4j**: Manages context and workflows using graph-based models.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores relational data, including RBAC policies and user accounts.
- **LibSodium**: Secures data with encryption and cryptographic utilities.
- **gRPC**: Enables cross-language communication and integration with Python-based AI services.

## Integration Points
- **Frontend**:
  - Provides APIs for the Console UI and Web UI to interact with backend services.
- **External Systems**:
  - Supports integration with third-party messaging systems and configuration management tools.

## Configuration and Security
- All configurations are stored in encrypted JSON files.
- Each transaction and entity (actions, workflows, messages) is assigned a GUID for audit trails.
- Built-in cost tracking ensures transparency for resource consumption.

## Development Goals
1. Ensure modularity for easy maintenance and scalability.
2. Build proactive monitoring and fault handling capabilities.
3. Provide a robust testing framework for all core components.
