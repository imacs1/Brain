# Backend Core: Actions

## Overview
The Actions component is a fundamental part of the Brain system, enabling dynamic execution of workflows through individual action handlers. Actions are data-driven and leverage reflection for runtime discovery and execution.

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time Message Prioritization**:
   - Actions are prioritized based on user entitlement (e.g., free, paid, enterprise) and message priority (e.g., override, high, medium, low).
   - The LoadBalancer service enforces prioritization rules and routes messages accordingly.

2. **Advanced RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
   - Each action integrates RBAC rules to determine permissions based on roles, time-based access, and user-level entitlements.
   - RBAC enforcement ensures compliance with security policies at runtime.

3. **Testing Framework**:
   - A comprehensive testing framework ensures that all action handlers function as intended.
   - Supports unit testing, integration testing, and functional testing.
   - Automated tests validate RBAC rules, prioritization behavior, and action chaining.

4. **Speculative Workflows**:
   - Support for workflows that dynamically chain multiple actions based on runtime conditions.
   - Enables testing "what-if" scenarios without impacting live workflows.
   - Seamless integration with the core system, ensuring actions and workflows interact predictably.

## Action Lifecycle
1. **Discovery**:
   - Actions are discovered at runtime by scanning predefined folders and assemblies using reflection.
   - Handlers are identified, validated, and registered in the routing table.

2. **Execution**:
   - When a message requests an action, the corresponding handler is invoked dynamically.
   - Handlers can execute logic, interact with external APIs, or call other services as needed.

3. **Logging and Error Handling**:
   - The Logger service tracks the lifecycle of each action, including start time, execution time, and completion status.
   - Errors are logged separately and reported to the Monitor service for analysis.

4. **RBAC and Cost Enforcement**:
   - Before execution, actions validate RBAC permissions and check for sufficient resources (e.g., credits for paid users).
   - If validation fails, the action is rejected with an appropriate response.

5. **Speculative Workflows**:
   - Actions can branch into alternate execution paths, providing insights into potential outcomes.
   - Results from speculative executions are logged and analyzed without modifying the live context.

## Configuration
- Actions are configured through JSON files stored in `Config/Actions`.
- Each action defines:
  - Handler name and description.
  - Supported parameters.
  - RBAC rules and cost information.
  - Associated message types for routing.
  - Speculative workflow dependencies, if applicable.

## Testing
- The testing framework for Actions includes:
  - Unit tests for individual handlers.
  - Integration tests for workflows involving multiple actions.
  - Functional tests to verify user-facing scenarios.
  - Speculative workflow validation to ensure correct branching logic.
