### **Cost Tracking and Token System**

Cost tracking in Project Brain is token-based, ensuring a flexible and scalable approach to pricing. Tokens abstract direct monetary costs, enabling dynamic adjustments based on demand, system changes, or feature upgrades.

### **Core Features**

1. **Token-Based Costs**:
   - Actions, messages, and workflows are associated with token costs.
   - Example: Translation = 5 tokens/1000 words, Summarization = 2 tokens/1000 words.

2. **Dynamic Token Valuation**:
   - Token values are decoupled from USD or other currencies.
   - Allows adjustments to token pricing without system-wide modifications.

3. **Per-Action and Workflow Costs**:
   - Each action or workflow step has a defined token cost, considering resource usage, processing time, and API calls.

4. **Quota Management**:
   - Integrated with RBAC and throttling mechanisms to manage token usage limits by user type (e.g., free, standard, enterprise).
   - Example: Free users = 100 tokens/day, Enterprise users = unlimited tokens.

5. **Audit Trails**:
   - Every transaction records a GUID, tokens used, and the associated user or service.
   - Supports transparent reporting and accountability.

### **Implementation Details**

1. **Cost Definition**:
   - Costs are defined in JSON configuration files for ease of updates and centralization.
   - Example structure:
     ```json
     {
       "actions": {
         "translate": { "cost_per_unit": 5, "unit": "1000 words" },
         "summarize": { "cost_per_unit": 2, "unit": "1000 words" }
       },
       "workflows": {
         "summarize_and_translate": { "cost_per_step": 7 }
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Integration with Quota Manager**:
   - Users and services have token balances, tracked by the Quota Manager.
   - Requests exceeding quotas are rejected with appropriate messages.

3. **Real-Time Cost Evaluation**:
   - Before executing an action or workflow, the system checks token availability.
   - If insufficient, requests are queued or rejected.

4. **Token Replenishment**:
   - Tokens are replenished based on subscription plans or manual purchases.
   - Example: Free users get a daily reset, paid users replenish via API.

### **Key Benefits**

- **Flexibility**:
  - Adaptable pricing across regions, user tiers, or system updates.
  
- **Transparency**:
  - Clear token usage and audit trails enhance trust and accountability.

- **Scalability**:
  - Simplifies cost scaling for new features or services without extensive reconfiguration.

---

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Token Market**:
   - Dynamic pricing based on supply-demand or feature popularity.

2. **Advanced Quota Controls**:
   - Tiered token pricing for higher usage.

3. **Third-Party Integration**:
   - Token systems compatible with external platforms or services.
