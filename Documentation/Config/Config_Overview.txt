## Context Configuration in Project Brain

### 1. Configuring Dynamic Context
The configuration system in Project Brain includes setup parameters for managing dynamic context. This configuration defines the context entities (e.g., `User`, `Session`, `Task`) and relationships in the system.

#### Context Configuration Items:
- **Node Configuration**: Each node representing a context entity is configured in the systemâ€™s configuration files.
- **Relationship Configuration**: Relationships between nodes (such as `ASSIGNED_TO`, `PARTICIPATES_IN`) are defined dynamically.
- **Workflow-Specific Context**: Workflow configurations specify which data should be included in the context for each workflow step.

### 2. Context Versioning and Persistence
Context data can be persisted in both **temporary** and **persistent** forms, with versioning implemented for traceability and rollback.

- **Versioning**: Context changes are tracked using timestamps and version numbers to ensure continuity and history.
  
### 3. Integration with External Services
Context can be passed to external services via API calls, enabling context-sensitive interactions across various services in Project Brain, such as AI models, third-party APIs, etc.
