# System Initialization and Registration

## Overview
This document describes the process for system initialization, where Actions, Messages, and Workflows are loaded from the database, registered in memory, and refreshed dynamically upon updates. It also details the obfuscation and encryption mechanisms used to secure database `.json` data.

---

## Key Steps in Initialization
1. **Database Query**:
   - At startup, the system queries the database to retrieve all Actions, Messages, and Workflows.
   - Each entry is stored in its encrypted form, and `.json` filenames are represented as GUIDs to obfuscate their identities.

2. **Dynamic Table Construction**:
   - A GUID-to-item name table is built dynamically by reading the encrypted `.json` content where the GUID is defined.
   - This table ensures mapping between GUIDs and their corresponding human-readable names.

3. **Registration of Endpoints**:
   - Retrieved entries are registered in memory as dictionaries:
     - `_registeredActions` for Actions.
     - `_registeredMessages` for Messages.
     - `_registeredWorkflows` for Workflows.
   - These dictionaries map GUIDs to their respective in-memory representations.

4. **Memory-only Decryption**:
   - Database content is decrypted only when it is loaded into memory.
   - At no point are decrypted contents written back to disk unless explicitly exported.

5. **Dynamic Refresh**:
   - If the database is updated, it triggers a refresh process:
     - Newly added or modified Actions, Messages, and Workflows are registered.
     - Obsolete entries are unregistered.

---

## Security Mechanisms
1. **Obfuscation**:
   - `.json` filenames in the database are replaced with GUIDs to obscure their identities.

2. **Encryption**:
   - All content within the `.json` files is encrypted using secure cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES).
   - This ensures data cannot be read or modified without proper decryption keys.

3. **GUID-to-Name Mapping**:
   - The dynamic GUID-to-item name table provides a temporary, in-memory reference for resolving item identities during runtime.

---

## Example Workflow
1. **Startup**:
   - Query the database for all Actions, Messages, and Workflows.
   - Decrypt the retrieved `.json` files in memory and build the GUID-to-name table.

2. **Endpoint Registration**:
   - Register each Action, Message, and Workflow in their respective dictionaries:
     - `_registeredActions["<GUID>"] = <DecryptedActionObject>`
     - `_registeredMessages["<GUID>"] = <DecryptedMessageObject>`
     - `_registeredWorkflows["<GUID>"] = <DecryptedWorkflowObject>`

3. **Database Update**:
   - On detecting updates:
     - Fetch the new or updated `.json` files.
     - Refresh the GUID-to-name table and corresponding dictionaries.

---

## Error Handling
1. **Missing GUIDs**:
   - If a GUID is missing from the database, log a warning and skip the registration for that entry.

2. **Decryption Failures**:
   - If decryption fails, log the error with details (excluding sensitive information) and notify the administrator.

3. **Refresh Conflicts**:
   - Handle conflicts during dynamic refresh by applying the latest changes from the database.

---

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Validate GUID-to-item mapping logic.
  - Test registration and unregistration mechanisms.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Simulate database updates and verify endpoint refresh behavior.
- **Security Tests**:
  - Confirm encryption and obfuscation mechanisms prevent unauthorized access.
