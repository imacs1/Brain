Here is the summarized memory context:

System Overview
Data-Driven Design: Dynamic routing for actions, workflows, and messages using reflection and JSON configuration files.
Dynamic Routing Tables: Created at startup; updated when services change or periodically.
Dependency Order: Actions load first, followed by messages, and then workflows to resolve dependencies.
Core Architecture
Base Service: Manages lifecycle, RBAC, cost tracking, monitoring, and logging.
Service Config and Instance: Encapsulates runtime service details, supporting dynamic scaling and monitoring.
Routing and Load Balancing: Determines the best service instance for handling messages based on priority, entitlements, and availability.
Monitoring and Fault Tolerance
Heartbeat Monitoring: Ensures service health.
Proactive Fault Handling: Identifies bottlenecks and enables scaling or mitigation.
Self-Diagnostics: Integrated testing and fault detection from the start.
Security and Compliance
Data Encryption: All configuration and data files are encrypted using LibSodium.
Audit Trails: GUIDs used for tracking all transactions and configurations.
Backend Components
Core modules: Actions, Messages, Workflows, Context, etc.
Services: ActionService, MessageService, WorkflowService, Logger, etc.
Storage: PostgreSQL and Neo4j for relational and graph-based requirements.
Frontend Design
Console UI: Menu-driven, extending later into a web-based or graphical interface.
Development and Maintenance
Documentation: Comprehensive, folder-aligned, with detailed headers and summaries.
Tools: Scripts for automation, diagnostics, and deployment.
Testing Framework: Supports unit, integration, functional, and end-to-end tests.
Guiding Principles
Dynamic and Modular: Avoid hardcoding, with flexible, replaceable components.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensures seamless operation across OS environments.
Future-Ready: Designed to support advanced monitoring, speculative workflows, and distributed systems.
This reflects the current refined design, priorities, and implementation goals.
