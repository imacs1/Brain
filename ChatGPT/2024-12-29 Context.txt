Summary of Current Implementation Details:
System Overview:

Data-Driven Architecture: Dynamic routing for actions, workflows, and messages, utilizing reflection and data files (JSON) to avoid hardcoding.
Dynamic Routing Tables: Built at startup by scanning JSON and code-based handlers. Updates triggered by service changes or periodic checks.
Workflow Dependence: Actions loaded first, messages second, workflows last to ensure dependencies are resolved.
Service Design:

Base Service: Encapsulates lifecycle management, RBAC, cost tracking, and logging. Supports both thread and process modes.
Service Config: Unified configuration for services, includes Logger, Registry, and scaling parameters.
Service Instance: Represents running services with dynamic scaling, RBAC, and fault tolerance mechanisms.
Monitoring and Fault Handling:

Heartbeat Monitoring: Ensures services are alive and functional.
Self-Diagnostics: Integrated from the start, including proactive fault detection and testing.
Lightweight Service Discovery: Tracks live services and bottlenecks for dynamic scaling.
Data Security:

All user, action, template, and message files encrypted.
GUIDs ensure audit trails for all transactions and configurations.
Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Avoids OS-specific libraries and uses standard constructs like Path.Combine for file paths.
Backend Components:

Includes core services (Action, Workflow, Message, Context, etc.).
PostgreSQL and Neo4j for database needs.
Supports gRPC for inter-service communication across languages (e.g., Python AI services).
Console UI:

Simple menu-driven interface for service, queue, and log management.
Designed for extensibility into a web or graphical UI later.
Phased Roadmap:

Phase 1: Set up folders, documentation, and foundational service components.
Phase 2: Implement dynamic routing, RBAC, and fault tolerance.
Phase 3: Build core services and integrate Neo4j and PostgreSQL.
Phase 4: Develop Console UI, workflows, and testing frameworks.
Phase 5: Expand to advanced features like speculative workflows and monitoring dashboards.
Documentation:

Follows folder structure by area, detailing design, implementation, and phased execution.
Includes headers with metadata (created/updated, copyright, etc.).

Guiding Principles: Data-driven design, avoiding hardcoding, using dynamic routing tables, RBAC, and ensuring audit trails with GUIDs.

Key Technologies:

Neo4j for dynamic context management.
PostgreSQL for relational data (e.g., user accounts, RBAC configurations).
gRPC for cross-language compatibility and communication.
Encrypted data files for security.
Execution Goals:

Phased implementation roadmap.
Emphasis on proactive monitoring, fault handling, and horizontal scaling.
Support for actions, messages, and workflows as dynamic entities.
Code Design:

No hardcoded message or action types.
Use of reflection for loading handlers dynamically.
Shared Sender object for internal and external communication.
Development Environment:

Cross-platform compatibility.
Focus on modularity and scalability in every phase.
